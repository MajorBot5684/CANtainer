Flashing CANboot and Klipper Firmware on Devices
This guide covers flashing your CAN devices (Octopus, EBB42, and Cartographer probe) with CANboot and Klipper firmware from within your Pimox VM environment.

Prerequisites
Pimox 8 VM running Ubuntu 24.04 Server LTS (headless)

USB passthrough enabled for the Octopus board acting as a CAN adapter

can0 interface configured and up (see can_interface_setup.md)

flash_can.py script from the Cartographer3D repository

Access to Cartographer prebuilt firmware files

Step 1: Prepare the VM Environment
Make sure your CAN interface is up and reachable:

bash
Copy
Edit
ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 1000000
ifconfig can0 txqueuelen 1000
Check CAN devices:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo python3 scripts/detect-can-devices.sh
You should see the Octopus, EBB42, and Cartographer probe listed (UUIDs will vary).

Step 2: Flash Octopus and EBB42 with CANboot and Klipper
Use the flash_can.py script to flash the Octopus and EBB42 boards:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 flash_can.py --device octopus --firmware klipper
python3 flash_can.py --device ebb42 --firmware klipper
This flashes the latest Klipper CAN firmware onto the respective boards.

Make sure you are running the script in the directory containing the firmware files or specify paths accordingly.

Step 3: Flash Cartographer Probe Firmware
The Cartographer probe requires its own firmware flashing procedure, typically handled by the official Cartographer3D tools.

If you have already followed the USB to CAN flashing guide from the official docs:

Cartographer USB to CANbus firmware switching

Then you can verify your probe firmware is active by checking CAN device detection output.

Step 4: Verify Firmware
After flashing, reset the devices or power cycle to ensure new firmware is loaded.

Use CAN device detection again:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo python3 scripts/detect-can-devices.sh
Confirm that devices respond and have the correct firmware versions.

Troubleshooting
If devices do not appear on can0, ensure USB passthrough and CAN interface are properly configured.

Re-run the setup-can-interface.sh script if necessary.

Check dmesg and system logs for USB or CAN errors.

Consult official Cartographer and Klipper documentation for firmware compatibility.

Once flashing is complete, you can proceed to configure Klipper and Cartographer software (see cartographer_setup.md).
